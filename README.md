## Summary
The main drawback of this webpage is that the only info it produces are UFO sightings from a predefined file, so it won't update automatically.
it may be a good idea to implement some form of scrapping so the list of sightings increase as more arte found. adding a section for recent news articles related to UFO sightings may also improve the amount of information this webpage can give.
